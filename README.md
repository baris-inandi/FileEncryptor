# FileEncryptor
File Encryptor is a lightweight tool that uses AES to encrypt and decrypt files on your computer.

HOW TO USE:
The program opens in a command line window. Type encrypt or decrypt to get started.

Tip: 'e' or 'd' also work instead of encrypt or decrypt.

From the file dialog, select any file to encrypt or an .aes file to decrypt. The program will ask for a password. (or to set one while encrypting) You can send or store encrypted files.
